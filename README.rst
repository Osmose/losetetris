A FlashPunk Game by Osmose

This is a WIP
=============
LoseTetris is not even close to being remotely playable. Don't expect to actually do anything with it yet.

Controls
========
* Left/Right - Move Block
* D - Rotate Block

Goal
====
The goal of LoseTetris is to lose a level of Tetris with the largest amount of blocks possible on the screen. No towers of blocks here, you have have to epically lose to win.
